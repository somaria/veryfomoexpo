# Cursor Rules for veryfomoexpo React Native Project

## Styling Guidelines
- Use NativeWind for styling as much as possible
- Avoid using StyleSheet.create() when NativeWind classes can be used instead
- Use className prop instead of style prop when using NativeWind
- For complex styling that can't be achieved with NativeWind, use StyleSheet as a fallback

## Code Structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use functional components with hooks
- Organize related components in dedicated folders

## Best Practices
- Follow React Native best practices
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Write clear comments for complex logic
